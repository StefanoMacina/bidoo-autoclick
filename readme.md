# âš¡ Screen OCR Auto-Clicker

This is a Python-based automation script that uses **Tesseract OCR**, **OpenCV**, and **PyAutoGUI** to detect text (numbers) from a specific area of the screen in real-time.  
When a target number (default `0`) appears, the script automatically triggers a mouse click.  
Itâ€™s ideal for automation, quick response systems, and visual screen monitoring tasks.
